# ScreenBlox

ScreenBlox makes screensharing to Roblox games easier!

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run `Launcher.py`
3. Profit???

Honestly, I can't understand the codebase (I, the person cleaning this up a bit, don't work with roblox studio and Luau), so the Maintainer can fix some stuff idk
